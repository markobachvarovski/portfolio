# My portfolio

This portfolio was created to showcase my projects and my work.

## Main page

This is the main page where you can see my name and a brief greeting. You're able to click the button that takes you to the About Me page or simply scroll down to access it.

## About me page

This is where I provide a brief introduction of who I am and what my interests are! My resume and a picture of me are also attached.

## Skills page

This is a little interactive widget where I've listed some of my skills in a circular cloud. They spin by default and upon hovering they will spin in the direction of the cursor.
The further the cursor is, the faster they'll spin and to stop them, you can hover over the middle of the cloud.

## Projects page

This is where I've displayed my projects. There is a short explanation of the project, and links provided to the live version online and their respective github repositories.
There is also a picture provided of their front-end or if the project has no graphical component, a picture relating to the project is provided.

## Contact page

Here you can find all my contact info as well as my social media links. You can click the email and the button 'Get in touch', both of which will prompt you to send me an email.\
You can click the icons of the social media below which will redirect you to my respective social media or you can click the up arrow to bring you back to the top.
